# NameCollection
Mod for just collecting a bunch of (not all really) Minecraft usernames you run into. Not really intended for public use. When using this mod, whenever a new player joins the world you're in, it adds their name to ".minecraft/namecollection/names.csv" (unless they're already in there)
